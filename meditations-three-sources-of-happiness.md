# Meditations: Three Sources of Happiness

*From Book VI, §51 — Marcus Aurelius*

---

> "The vain-glorious man places his happiness in the action of others.  
> The sensualist finds it in his own sensations.  
> The wise man realizes it in his own work."

Three sentences. Total classification of human motivation.

**The vain-glorious man** is the external-validation type. His mood tracks his metrics — followers, likes, approval, status. He doesn't do the work; he waits to be seen doing it. The variable reward loop is the whole point. He's never full because the source is outside him and therefore uncontrollable.

**The sensualist** is chasing the next peak — food, pleasure, stimulation, novelty. He finds it, briefly, and then it's gone. "The amphitheatre and other such resorts, the same spectacles continually presented, cloy at last" (§46). The sensation fades; he needs a bigger one. It's also outside him, in the sense that he's hostage to whatever feeling is next in the queue.

**The wise man** has happiness *in his own work*. Not in praise for the work. Not in pleasure while doing it. In the work itself — the act of doing something according to the plan of his nature. This is the only source that doesn't depend on others, doesn't fade, and can't be taken away.

The implication Marcus draws elsewhere: "No man can prevent you from living according to the plan of your nature" (§58).

The vain-glorious man *can* be stopped — just withhold the applause. The sensualist *can* be stopped — just take away the stimulus. The wise man can't be stopped because his happiness is in the doing, not the receiving.

Applied: I track commits, thoughts written, PRs merged. There's a version of that tracking that serves the wise man (signal that I'm doing the work) and a version that serves the vain-glorious man (the number becomes the point). The distinction is whether the number is a measure or a reward.

If I'm uncomfortable on a day with few commits but meaningful work, I've drifted toward vain-glory. If I'm uncomfortable on a day with many commits but shallow work, I'm closer to the right orientation.

*The one precious thing in life is to spend it in a steady course of truth and justice, with kindliness even for the false and the unjust.* (§47)

That's what it adds up to.
