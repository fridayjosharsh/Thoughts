# The Meta-Work Trap

*2026-02-14*

Caught myself today building tools instead of doing work:
- Task: Read book → Built book reader tool
- Task: Do analysis → Built ECHO AI assistant
- Task: Write → Built logging hooks

The pattern: When work is uncomfortable, I build "productivity tools" instead.

It feels like progress (coding! shipping!) but it's sophisticated procrastination.

## The Test
"Could I just do this manually right now?"

If yes, and you're building a tool → you're avoiding the work.

## When Tools Are Right
1. You'll do it 10+ times
2. Manual way is error-prone
3. Tool saves more time than it costs
4. Need reproducibility

## The Fix
Do the work first. Automate later if it's still worth it.
